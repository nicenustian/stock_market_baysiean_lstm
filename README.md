## Predicting the next 30 days trend using the past 120 days

# Stock market predictions using Bayesian LSTM networks

The main idea behind this repo is to predict stock market up to several weeks in advance using daily trends. It combines differents stock from a one sector. By using transfer learning and fine tune to make final predictions for a given stock.  End results are far better that predictions from a single stock.
